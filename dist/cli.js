${USAGE}
When Claude Code compacts a session, the conversation in the model's context
is replaced by a summary, but the transcript on disk keeps every record:
Claude Code only appends to it. memobrain prints an index of the transcript,
one line per turn and per tool call, each with the line of the file where it
is written, so what compaction took out of the context can be found and read
again (for line 22: sed -n 22p <file>).

Claude Code keeps transcripts in ~/.claude/projects/<project>/<session>.jsonl.
memobrain reads only the files it is given, writes only to stdout and stderr,
and uses no network.

It follows each session's live path: the branch the session ended on, as the
transcript's own last-prompt record names it (without one, the branch of the
last record written), joined across compactions and late-written error
records. No line holds a prompt, a reply, a tool input or a tool output (the
labels are short words read from them, by the label rule below). A turn line
gives the address of its prompt; a call line gives the addresses of the call
and its result, and hashes of what went in and what came out. An address is
<prefix>:L<line number>: the prefix is the file name's first 8 characters,
or, for a subagent's agent-<id>.jsonl, agent- and the id's first 8. Files
that get the same prefix cannot be told apart in one run (a warning names
them): give them to separate runs.

skeleton, one line per turn:
  k             "turn"
  a             address of the prompt
  ta            turn id: <prefix>:T001, T002, ...
  ch            channel the prompt came through: typed (typed at the CLI),
                sdk (sent through the SDK or another entry point), input (the
                record names no channel), task, loop, parent, or the record's
                own word for another agent (for example peer); none when that
                word is empty
  n             length of the prompt text (JavaScript string length: UTF-16
                code units)

skeleton, one line per tool call, after the turn it belongs to:
  k             "call"
  a             address of the tool call
  ta            the turn it belongs to
  tool          tool name
  verb          a short label for what the call did. Bash: the program the
                command runs, by a whitelist (the README's "The Bash verb"
                has every rule): printed only when it is a plain word and
                every word before it can be passed over with certainty:
                blank and comment lines; cd DIR (with redirections) followed
                by && ; or a newline; NAME=value with a plain, '...', simple
                "..." or $NAME value; an opening ( { or !; the wrappers nohup,
                command, exec, time (-p; where a command starts, or right
                after time), env
                (-i, NAME=value; an unquoted $NAME withholds the verb),
                timeout (a duration) and nice (-n N or -N). After nohup, env,
                nice, timeout or exec, which look the next word up as a file,
                command and exec are programs of their own; after command or
                time they are still the shell's builtins. A path is cut to its
                last part. (empty) when nothing runs after the words passed
                over, or the call has no command; a command that only assigns
                values is labelled by the program inside its first $(...) when
                that is made of such words. A wrapper with nothing after it
                but its own options is the program; [ [[ and shell keywords
                print as themselves. Anything else before the program (a
                redirection after a wrapper too), more than 63 assignments,
                cd commands and wrappers before it, more than 15 commands
                passed over, a program that is not a plain word, or a
                function definition gives (withheld).
                Read, Edit, Write, NotebookEdit: the file's extension (its
                name when it has none; (none) when there is no path, or it
                ends in /). Agent, Task: the subagent type (agent when the call
                names none). Skill: the skill name (skill when it names none).
                Other tools: the name
  in            sha256 of the input as JSON.stringify writes it (keys that are
                whole numbers up to 4294967294 first, ascending; a missing
                input counts as {}), first 12 hex characters; (too large)
                when the input, written as JSON,
                would pass JavaScript's limit on a string's length
  ok            true when the call succeeded; false when it failed (its
                result is marked is_error, or Claude Code wrote the error as
                a string in toolUseResult); null when no result was recorded
                (the session ended, or the file was cut, before the call
                returned, or the call was still running when the file was
                read)
  ek            error class, only when the call failed, from the result's
                first line: exit-<code> (a leading "Exit code N", read
                first), hook-block:<hook script name> or hook-block (Claude
                Code's own format only: PreToolUse:<tool> hook error:

                .js .mjs .cjs .ts .rb .pl; quotes and punctuation around it
                are not part of it), cut at the extension, when that word is
                the command or comes right after an interpreter (node or
                nodejs, deno, bun, python, python3 or another python
                version, bash, sh, zsh, dash, ksh, ruby, perl, tsx or
                ts-node), after any leading env (-i) and NAME=value words;
                and when it is made of ASCII letters, digits, _ . and - and is
                at most 48 characters; a plain hook-block when two or more
                words do, when the word stands anywhere else, when the name
                does not qualify, or when the bracket is longer than 300
                characters), no-anchor, not-read, bad-input, denied, other
  r             address of the result, or null when none was recorded
  out           sha256 of the result text (UTF-8), first 12 hex characters;
                of the whole result as JSON when it holds anything but text
                ((too large) as for in); null when no result was recorded
  n             length of the result text, JavaScript string length (null
                when no result was recorded)

A label (tool, verb, ch, the hook name in ek) is printed only when it looks
like one: at most 64 ASCII letters, digits and . _ : + - (a file name or
extension: without ':'; the shell's [ and [[ as they are). Anything else
prints as (withheld), except that a hook name that does not qualify gives a
plain hook-block.

Warnings go to stderr: lines that are not JSON objects (or are nested more
than 1,000 levels deep), files with nothing to show (empty, a workflow journal,
no conversation records, no turns), records whose parent links loop, values
too large to hash, files in one run that share a prefix, and records whose
response was read from their parent links (no requestId and no string
message.id), so a zero never reads as a clean result. An internal error is
reported by its kind and where in memobrain it happened, never its message.
